# Introduction to MoSCoW Method #

I would like to introduce MoSCoW method with a quote from the Wikipedia
page about this technique:

*The Moscow method is a prioritization technique used in management, business analysis,
project management, and software development to reach a common understanding with 
stakeholders on the importance they place on the delivery of each 
requirement; it is also known as MoSCoW prioritization or MoSCoW analysis.
The term Moscow itself is an acronym derived from the first letter of each of four prioritization 
categories: M - Must have, S - Should have, C - Could have, W - Won't have.*
